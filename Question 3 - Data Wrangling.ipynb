    "# Conclusions from Identifying Duplicate Transaction\n",
    "Inspecting the transaction data revealed a set activities that complicate analysis of customer transactions. I identified chains of non-standard events including multi-swipes, reversals, address verifications that reflect the complexities of \"real-world\" transactions. Answers to the specific prompts are summarized below:\n",
    "* Reversed transactions occured in 20,303 records and totaled to \\$2,821,782.50\n",
    "* Multi-swipe transactions occured in 7,450 recoreds and totaled \\$1,103,132.25, not including the original \"normal\" transaction. \n",
    "* During my review of these duplicate transactions, I identified that many duplicates existed within chains of non-standard transactions. An example of these chains would be, purchase-purchase-reversal. I mapped these event sequences to understand their frequency and potential impact on customers. I found:\n",
    "    * Non-standard event chains occur in 3.31% of all transaction records (26026 records) and in 1.70% of transaction records, if you exclude the original transaction (13405 records)\n",
    "    * Event chains have 1.5 purchase transactions on average and infrequently include address verifications (3.3% of the time)\n",
    "    * Almost half of all event chains contain a reversal (45.3%). This suggests that the remainder are left un-resolved at time of purchase.\n",
    "    * 28% of all reversals occur in event chains (5723 reversals of the 20303 total). Reversals also occur with higher frequency in chains than outside of chains (22.0% of chain transactions are reversals vs 1.9% of non-chain transactions). Reversals occuring outside of chains appear to happen well after the initial purchase suggesting a refund or return as opposed to an in-the-moment series of swipes and events.\n",
    "    * Address verification chains, while relatively rare, included a reversals almost half of the time. Assuming that address verifications has standard procedures, it is suprising to see a different compositions of these chains of events. Furthermore, address verifications are no cost, so the reversal may be unnecessary.  \n",
    "    * I also observed transactions where the amount was greater than the available money for the account. These transactions were slightly more frequent in a event chains (occured in 4.2% of event chains transactions compared to 3.8% of non-chain transactions). These transactions could be worth fututre investigation and more rigorous statistical treatment in future work. \n",
    "\n",
    "Questions for subject matter experts:\n",
    "* I assumed a time window of 10 minutes would reasonably capture multi-swipes, do we have evidence to suggest a different time window?\n",
    "* What is customer feedback about transaction reversal and non-standard event chains? Are they satisified with Captial One's management of these events?\n",
    "* What is the purpose of address verification transaction and what is the proper way for a merchant to process them?\n",
    "* How are transactions where the amount was greater than the available money for the account handled in the the transaction processing system and how is that reflected in the final transactions data?\n",
    "    * It is not clear in the transaction data if those transactiosn are allowed to result in a purchase or not. Depending on the answer, it could influence the quantification of non-standard event chains. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Analytic next steps, given more time:\n",
    "* Compare different sized time windows for event chains to understand the senstivity of my multi-swipe detection.\n",
    "* Statistically test if the frequencies of non-standard events are different in and out of non-standard event chains. I left that assessment at a comparison of frequencies, but could generate hypothesis tests if needed.\n",
    "* Review the costs associated with reversals, multi-swipes, and non-standard event chains to understand if customers were negatively impacted by these events. For example, if chains were fully refunded or if customers ended up paying for duplicate purchases. If there was a significant negative impact, those unresolved chains could be flagged for review to ensure customers are not being over-charged by merchants.\n",

    "# Identifying Multi-Swipes\n",
    "To identify multi-swipes, I look for identical transactions occuring at a given customer-merchant pair within a time window. Reviewing these instances suggests that multi-swipes can be a part of more complex chains of events involving multi-swipes, reversals, and address verfications. In order to fully understand these chains of events, I identify when they occur and map each chain to unique identifier. This mapping enable the quantification of the frequency of multi-swipes as well as other events. The following cells create that mapping and quantification."
